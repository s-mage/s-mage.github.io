What happened?
==============

I just watched this video: https://youtu.be/rE3j_RHkqJc

Everybody knows that social networks is a time killer. But it turns out
that it's also a nice way to hear what you want to hear.

I normally don't use social networks because I have more interesting things
to do. But when I do I start to do it too much and almost see how my time
turns to dust. In the end of each such period I gather my last will and
decide not to use all this anymore.

Today is such a day. Normally I would write some future plans for myself
and fight with longing for twitter for couple of days and then load myself
with something decent.

Problem is I don't want to. I'm bored with twitter and football but I don't
want to go to gym and start learning a new language (or a programming language
or something else).

But I don't want just lie on the sofa and stare to celling. I'm just graduated,
so now I'm a master of science. My speciality was automating of experiments (
whatever it means) and I'm gonna try to make one.

Back to the video. There is an interesting thing in it. Groups with different
opinions don't argue with each other, they mostly argue with themselves how
angry the other group makes them.

Seems like a great statement to prove! Actually it's two statements:

* In most threads opinions should be almost the same in each thread
* The long-live threads should be filled with anger.

Actually I think that there also thould be a trigger -- some person who
has different opinion than the major of people and makes the discussion hot.

As a flame-generator we would use news. Because I'm from Russia I would
like to analyze the latest news that russians now can flight to Turkey.
And because of everyone talks about it I want some news about brexit.

When I was younger (even younger) I liked to spend time on anonimous forums.
And it was a shame if someone posts a thing that is a copypast and you
reply to it. If this investigation will show what I just suggested it would
mean that now almost everyone talks to copypast.
